- title: Fetch and Forge:Efficient Dataset Condensation for Object Detection
  image: 24_NIPS_DCOD.png
  description: current research on DC mainly focuses on image classification, with less exploration of object detection. As a remedy, we propose DCOD, the first dataset condensation framework for object detection. It operates in two stages: Fetch and Forge, initially storing key localization and classification information into model parameters, and then reconstructing synthetic images via model inversion.

- title: Re-ID-leak:Membership Inference Attacks Against Person Re-identification
  image: 24_IJCV_ReIDLeak.png
  description: Most existing MI attack methods focus on classification models, while Re-ID follows a distinct paradigm for training and inference. Re-ID is a fine-grained recognition task that involves complex feature embedding, and the model outputs commonly used by existing MI algorithms, such as logits and losses, are inaccessible during inference. We propose a novel MI attack method based on the distribution of inter-sample similarity, which involves sampling a set of anchor images to represent the similarity  distribution that is conditioned on a target image.

- title: Reviving static charts into live charts
  image: 24_TVCG_LiveChart.png
  description: Data charts are prevalent across various fields due to their efficacy in conveying complex data relationships. However, static charts may sometimes struggle to engage readers and efficiently present intricate information, potentially resulting in limited understanding. We introduce "Live Charts," a new format of presentation that decomposes complex information within a chart and explains the information pieces sequentially through rich animations and accompanying audio narration.

- title: Hierarchically Recognizing Vector Graphics and A New Chart-based Vector Graphics Dataset
  image: 24_TPAMI_Yolat++.png
  description: The conventional approach to image recognition has been based on raster graphics, which can suffer from aliasing and information loss when scaled up or down. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the benefits of vector graphics for object localization and classification. Our method, called YOLaT (You Only Look at Text), takes the textual document of vector graphics as input, rather than rendering it into pixels. We propose YOLaT++ to learn Multi-level Abstraction Feature Learning from Primitive Shapes to Curves and Points. On the other hand, given few public datasets focus on vector graphics, data-driven learning cannot exert its full power on this format. We provide a large-scale and challenging dataset for Chart-based Vector Graphics Detection and Chart Understanding, termed VG-DCU, with vector graphics, raster graphics, annotations, and raw data drawn for creating these vector charts.

- title: Adaptive Discriminative Regularization for Visual Classification
  image: 24_IJCV_ADR.png
  description: How to improve discriminative feature learning is central in classification. In this paper, we embrace the real-world data distribution setting in that some classes share semantic overlaps due to their similar appearances or concepts. Regarding this hypothesis, we propose a novel regularization to improve discriminative learning. We first calibrate the estimated highest likelihood of one sample based on its semantically neighboring classes, then encourage the overall likelihood predictions to be deterministic by imposing an adaptive exponential penalty.

- title: Invisible backdoor attack with dynamic triggers against person re-identification
  image: 23_TIFS_backdoor.png
  description: Existing backdoor attack methods follow an all-to-one or all-to-all attack scenario, where all the target classes in the test set have already been seen in the training set. However, ReID is a much more complex fine-grained open-set recognition problem, where the identities in the test set are not contained in the training set. To ameliorate this issue, we propose a novel backdoor attack on deep ReID under a new all-to-unknown scenario, called Dynamic Triggers Invisible Backdoor Attack (DT-IBA). Instead of learning fixed triggers for the target classes from the training set, DT-IBA can dynamically generate new triggers for any unknown identities.

- title: Detecting Overlapped Objects in X-ray Security Imagery by a Label-aware Mechanism
  image: 22_tifs_clcxray.jpg
  description: One of the key challenges to the X-ray security checkis to detect the overlapped items in backpacks or suitcases in the X-ray images. Most existing methods improve the robustness of models to the object overlapping problem by enhancing the underlying visual information such as colors and edges. However, this strategy ignores the situations in that the objects have similar visual clues as to the background, and objects overlapping each other. Since the two cases rarely appear in existing datasets, we contribute a novel dataset – Cutters and Liquid Containers X-ray Dataset (CLCXray) to complete the related research.

  description: The connection structure in the convolutional layers of most deep learning-based algorithms used for the classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has typically been in the forward direction. In this study, an end-to-end alternately updated spectral–spatial convolutional network (AUSSC) with a recurrent feedback structure is used to learn refined spectral and spatial features for HSI classification.
