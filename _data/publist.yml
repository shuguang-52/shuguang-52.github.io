- title: Detecting Overlapped Objects in X-ray Security Imagery by a Label-aware Mechanism
  image: 22_tifs_clcxray.jpg
  description: One of the key challenges to the X-ray security checkis to detect the overlapped items in backpacks or suitcases inthe X-ray images. Most existing methods improve the robustnessof models to the object overlapping problem by enhancingthe underlying visual information such as colors and edges.However, this strategy ignores the situations that the objectshave similar visual clues as to the background, and objectsoverlapping each other. Since the two cases rarely appear inexisting datasets, we contribute a novel dataset – Cutters andLiquid Containers X-ray Dataset (CLCXray) to complete therelated research.

- title: Alternately Updated Spectral–Spatial Convolution Network for the Classification of Hyperspectral Images
  image: aussc_19_remote_sensing.png
  description: The connection structure in the convolutional layers of most deep learning-based algorithms used for the classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has typically been in the forward direction. In this study, an end-to-end alternately updated spectral–spatial convolutional network (AUSSC) with a recurrent feedback structure is used to learn refined spectral and spatial features for HSI classification.
